# Architecture Task Force
This task force is intended to deliver a reference architecture for what the OpenWallet Foundation is looking to build. We are using [issues tagged with `module`](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/architecture-task-force/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Amodule) to define the different modules that we expect to find in the reference architecture.

## Conceptual Architecture (DRAFT)

### Storage
```mermaid
graph TD
  subgraph S[Storage]
    subgraph ES[Encrypted Storage]
      esLS[Encrypted Local Storage]
      esCS[Encrypted Cloud Storage]
      esTBD["..."]
    end
    subgraph KS[Key Storage]
      TEE[Trusted Execution Environment]
      KV[Software Key Vault]
    end
  end
```
The storage module is responsible for holding the different digital objects that are contained within the wallet. There are two different types of storage that should be considered:
1. Encrypted Storage
1. Key Storage
